Maximize OR [Editorial]


Any number less than A when taken bitwise or with A will always result in the number which
is either same as A or higher than A. The task here is to find all the numbers which will
result higher than A. We can solve this by finding the numbers which will result A when
taken bitwise OR with A. This can be calculated by counting the number of set bits in A.
For example  9 is written as 1001 in its binary representation. Observation here is than
if we take any number which has 1 in the 2nd or 3rd position of its binary representation
then the bitwise or result will always be higher than A. So we can take only the number
which has 1 in the same position as in A. This can be calculated by
x = 2^(Number of set bits in A)-1 So our required answer will be n-x Number of set bit can
be calculated by Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm  O(logn) time complexity.
